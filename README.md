# Introduction to SLURM for FUNDI tutorials 2023
This is a simple introduction to SLURM, the powerful cluster management and job scheduling system. In this beginner-friendly tutorial, you'll explore the essentials of SLURM, learn how to optimize your job allocation, and get up to speed with the tools and techniques to learn more about cluster computing. 🌐💻.
The default jupyter notebook github readme does not display RawNBconvert cells. Therefore, you need to clone the repo, to use all the code.

We will focus more on how to run your jobs efficiently on the MPCDF's Hercules cluster (https://docs.mpcdf.mpg.de/doc/computing/clusters/systems/Radioastronomy.html). The cluster used by students in Bonn.

What's Inside? 📚
In this introductory tutorial, we'll dive into:

SLURM Basics: Get a solid understanding of what SLURM is and how it operates.

Partitions: Explore the role of partitions in SLURM and how they impact your job allocation.

MPI and OpenMP Jobs: Discover how to manage and optimize parallel jobs using MPI and OpenMP.

Job Arrays: Learn about job arrays to effectively handle multiple similar jobs.

Launching GPU scripts: We will compile and launch a simple CUDA script.

SLURM Job Prioritization: Learn about prioritizing your jobs for faster allocation and improved performance.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have gained valuable insights into the world of SLURM and be well-equipped to leverage its capabilities for efficient cluster computing. Let's get started and unleash the power of SLURM! 🔥🚀
